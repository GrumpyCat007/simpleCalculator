1.This is a test projet for creating a simple calculator using html,css,js.
2.This is not the final/complete version of the calculator, you can perform simple addition, subtraction,multipication and division ops can be perfomerd by this.
3.There are a lot of bugs if you dive deeper , for example you can enter as many symbols at start, or after any number, this can be fixed by simple checks but I am too lazy to do this, but hey you can take your time and modify this.
